# Creatures

Creatures are passive neutral [[enemies]] in the [[jungle]]. Creatures randomly spawn in the Jungle. There are two types of creatures: Creeps and Giants.

## Creeps

Creeps are small Creatures which have low to medium health pool, and deal low to medium damage. Creeps only drop gold on kill.

## Giants

Giants are large Creatures with a high health pool and deal high damage. Giants drop gold and sometimes Jungle [[materials]] on kill.
