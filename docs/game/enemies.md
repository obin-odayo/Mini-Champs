# Enemies

Enemies come in a variety of health pools,  sizes, speeds, and [[crystal damage]]. Enemies can be damaged by [[allies]] and the [[mini-champs]].

All Enemies drop [[gold]] which can be used to recruit [[allies]]. While larger Enemies drop [[materials]] which can be used to buy [[equipment]].
