# Bosses

Bosses are large non-playable characters (NPCs) which have a massive health pool and can deal large damage to both the [[mini-champs]] and [[allies]]. 

They move slow but if they reach your [[Crystal]] it gets instantly destroyed.

They spawn only at certain stages of the game, and the round will not end unless they die.

Bosses drop alot of [[gold]] and [[materials]] on death. They also give experience if Mini Champs are near them when they died.

Bosses can kill Allies and Mini Champs. Killed allies do not respawn. On the otherhand, if Mini Champs get killed by Bosses, they respawn after a short while. The respawn timer for Mini Champs depend on how many times they have died already.
