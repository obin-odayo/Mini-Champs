# Bosses

Bosses are large non-playable characters (NPCs) which have a massive health pool and can deal large damage to both the [[mini-champs]] and [[allies]]. 

They move slow but if they reach your [[Crystal]] it gets instantly destroyed.

They spawn only at certain stages of the game, and the round will not end unless they die.

Bosses drop alot of [[gold]] and [[materials]] on death. They also give experience if Mini Champs are near them when they died.
