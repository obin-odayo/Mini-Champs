# Crystal

Is the heart of the [[map]], protect the Crystal at all costs. When the Crystal gets destroyed, from [[enemies]] attacking it or [[bosses]] reaching it the game ends.

Crystals are usually located at the edge of the map, but it is always at the end of [[the-path]]. 

A [[map]] will at least have one Crystal. Meaning some maps could have more than one Crystal.
